....... describes the title #. We may disagree with what people say, but will gather ourselves for the rights of a fellow human being. Hashtags brings out people of different caste n creed and ethnicity together to stand for a particular cause; for the sake of humankind. # , our college magazine of the year 2020 brings out the creativity and vigor of our students who tirelessly worked to make it happen in this global pandemic era. It was supposed to be out by may, june---- but the changed scenarios forced us to extend the date and to come up with different strategies. The sincere efforts put in by the faculties guided the magazine team throughout this laborious process.
Their words will thaw the ice that engulfs the generation as prejudices and suppressions and will wipe clean the colors that stained our eyes. To put it in words, transparency serves as the color of our magazine."" />
